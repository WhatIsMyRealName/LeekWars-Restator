# LeekWars Restator (revisited)

[WEBSITE](https://leek-wars-restator.vercel.app/)

This project was inspired from the original [restator](http://leekwars.restator.free.fr/) project

It is a tool to theorycraft builds & player stats for the coding game [LeekWars](https://leekwars.com/)

You can also install the tampermonkey script to export a leek's build directly from it's leekwars page using the [TamperMonkey Extension](https://github.com/Bux42/Leekwars-Tampermonkey)

The original project was outdated (LeekWars now has chips, RAM, Cores etc) so I decided to make my own

It is still a work in progress
